# Welcome to Lemory

Lemory is a school project create by Pascal Abt, Lukas König, Benjamin Schellmann and Nicolas Schüssling. Lemory is a Memory type learning game targeted for elementary school. 

# The Lemory API

The API is an [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)ful Web Service which allows any Application supporting the HTTP protocol to access it. It provides endpoints for all needed database operations. The API was built with NodeJS and TypeScript for better Syntax releiability. To create and easy to use Webservice ExpressJS was used.

# The Java Lemory HTTP Client 

The Lemory HTTP Client allows for easy interfacing with the Lemory NodeJs API within Java. It's made to simplify the development of the Lemory JavaFX program. 
The Client is built with Apache HTTPClient for sending HTTP Request, Google Guava for encrypting passwords and Google Gson for parsing JSON.

# The JavaFX Lemory Prototype

The Lemory JavaFX Prototype reused an old version of Memory we created in an earlier school project. As the name states it is an early prototype just used for showcasing purpuses and is not going to reveive refienment. It makes use of the Java Lemory HTTP Cleint and has most features the final product will have.

# Future Plans

The Goal of this project is to have an App built with NativeScript and an Website to play Lemory. There are not plans for the JavaFX version to be included in the final product.
